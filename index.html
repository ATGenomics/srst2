<p>Short Read Sequence Typing for Bacterial Pathogens</p>

<p>This program is designed to take Illumina sequence data, a MLST database and/or a database
of gene sequences (e.g. resistance genes, virulence genes, etc) and report the presence of
STs and/or reference genes.</p>

<p>Current release - v0.1.3 - Feb 6, 2014</p>

<p>Dependencies:</p>

<p>python (v2.7.5), scipy</p>

<p>bowtie2 v2.1.0     <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml</a></p>

<p>SAMtools v0.1.18   <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.18/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.18/</a> (NOTE 0.1.19 DOES NOT WORK)</p>

<p>Updates in v0.1.3</p>

<ul>Fixed a bug that occurred while trying to type genes from a user-supplied database (see issue #5, thanks to Scott Long)</ul>

<ul>Fixed a bug in gene detection reporting - genes are now correctly reported by cluster, rather than by gene symbol (see issue #7)</ul>

<ul>Added maximum divergence option for reporting (--max_divergence), default is now to report only hits with <10% divergence from the database (see issue #8)</ul>

<ul>Added parameter to pass to bowtie2 parameter '-u N' to stop mapping after the first N reads. Default behaviour remains to map all reads. However, for large read sets (e.g. >100x), extra reads do not help and merely increase the time taken for mapping and scoring, and you may want to limit to the first million reads (100x of a 2 Mbp genome) using '--stop_after 1000000'.</ul>

<a name="basic-usage---mlst" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage---mlst"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic usage - MLST</h1>

<p>1 - Gather your input files:</p>

<p>(i) sequence reads (this example uses paired reads in gzipped fastq format, see below for options)</p>

<p>(ii) a fasta sequence database to match to. For MLST, this means a fasta file of all allele sequences. If you want to assign STs, you also need a tab-delim file which defines the ST profiles as a combination of alleles. You can retrieve these files automatically from pubmlst.org/data/ using the script provided:</p>

<p>getmlst.py --species "Escherichia coli"</p>

<p>2 - Run MLST:</p>

<p>srst2 --input_pe strainA_1.fastq.gz strainA_2.fastq.gz --output strainA_test --log 
    --mlst_db Escherichia_coli.fasta --mlst_definitions ecoli.txt</p>

<p>3 - Check the outputs:</p>

<p>(i) MLST results are output in: "strainA_test__mlst__Escherichia_coli__results.txt"</p>

<h1>
<a name="input-read-formats-and-options" class="anchor" href="#input-read-formats-and-options"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Input read formats and options</h1>

<p>Any number of readsets can be provided using --input_se (for single end reads) and/or --input_pe (for paired end reads). You can provide both types of reads at once. Note however that if you do this, each readset will be typed one by one (in serial). So if it takes 2 minutes to type each read set, and you provide 10 read sets, it will take 20 minutes to get your results. The better way to proces lots of samples quickly is to give each one its own srst2 job (e.g. submitted simultaneously to your job scheduler or server); then compile the results into a single report using "srst2 --prev_output *results.txt --output all". That way each readset's 2 minutes of analysis is occurring in parallel on different nodes, and you'll get your results for all 10 samples in 2 minutes rather than 20.</p>

<h3>
<a name="read-formats" class="anchor" href="#read-formats"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Read formats</h3>

<p>Reads can be in any format readable by bowtie2. The format is passed on to the bowtie2 command via the --read_type flag in srst2. The default format is fastq (passed to bowtie 2 as q); other options are qseq=solexa, f=fasta. So to use fasta reads, you would need to tell srst2 this via '--read_type f'.</p>

<p>Reads may be gzipped.</p>

<h3>
<a name="read-names" class="anchor" href="#read-names"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Read names</h3>

<p>Srst2 can parse Illumina MiSeq reads files; we assume that files with names in the format 'XXX_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz' and 'XXX_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz' are the forward and reverse reads from a sample named 'XXX'. So, you can simply use 'srst2 --input_pe XXX_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz XXX_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz' and srst2 will recognise these as forward and reverse reads of a sample named XXX. If you have single rather than paired MiSeq reads, you would use 'srst2 --input_se XXX_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz'.</p>

<h3>
<a name="paired-reads" class="anchor" href="#paired-reads"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paired reads</h3>

<p>If you have paired reads that are named in some way other than the Illumina MiSeq format, e.g. from the SRA or ENA public databases, you need to tell srst2 how to pass these to bowtie2.
bowtie2 requires forward and reverse reads to be supplied in separate files, e.g strainA_1.fastq.gz and strainA_2.fastq.gz. srst2 attempts to sort reads supplied via --input_pe into read pairs, based on the suffix (_1, _2 in this example) that occurs before the file extension (.fastq.gz in this example). So if you supplied --input_pe strainA_1.fastq.gz strainB_1.fastq.gz strainA_2.fastq.gz strainB_2.fastq.gz, srst2 would sort these into two pairs (strainA_1.fastq.gz, strainA_2.fastq.gz) and (strainB_1.fastq.gz, strainB_2.fastq.gz) and pass each pair on to bowtie2 for mapping. By default, the suffixes are assumed to be "_1" for forward reads and "_2" for reverse reads, but you can tell srst2 if you have other conventions, via --forward and --reverse. E.g. if your files were named strainA_read1.fastq.gz and strainA_read2.fastq.gz, you would use these commands: --input_pe strainA_read1.fastq.gz strainA_read2.fastq.gz --forward _read1 --reverse _read2. </p>

<h3>
<a name="sample-names" class="anchor" href="#sample-names"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sample names</h3>

<p>Sample names are taken from the first part of the read file name (before the suffix if you have paired reads). E.g. 'strainA_1.fastq.gz' is assumed to belong to a sample called "strainA"; 'strainB_C_1.fastq.gz" would be assumed to belong to a sample called "strainB_C". These sample names will be used to name all output files, and will appear in the results files.</p>

<h1>
<a name="mlst-database-format" class="anchor" href="#mlst-database-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MLST Database format</h1>

<p>MLST databases are specified by allele sequences, and a profiles table. These can be downloaded from the public databases, ready to use with srst2, using the provided script getmlst.py (see above).</p>

<h3>
<a name="allele-sequences-file-fasta-format" class="anchor" href="#allele-sequences-file-fasta-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Allele sequences file, fasta format.</h3>

<p>--mlst_db alleles.fasta</p>

<p>This should contain ALL allele sequences for the MLST scheme; i.e. if there are 7 loci in the scheme, then the sequences of all alleles from all 7 loci should appear together in this file. If you have one file per locus, just cat these together first. If you use getmlst.py, this is done for you.</p>

<p>--mlst_delimiter '-'</p>

<p>The names of the alleles (i.e. the fasta headers) are critical for a functioning MLST scheme and therefore for correct calling of STs. There are two key components to every fasta header: the name of the locus (e.g. in E. coli these are adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, recA) and the number assigned to the allele (1, 2, 3 etc). These are usually separated by a delimiter like '-' or '_'; e.g. in the E. coli scheme, alleles are named adk-1, fumC-10, etc. For ST calling to work properly, srst2 needs to know what the delimiter is. By default, we assume it is '-' as this is the most common; however some schemes use '_' (e.g. in the C. difficile scheme, the first allele is 'adk_1', so you would need to set --mlst_delimiter '_' on the srst2 command line). If you use getmlst.py, it will remind you of this and try to guess for you what the most likely delimiter is.</p>

<h3>
<a name="mlst-definitions-file-tab-delimited-format" class="anchor" href="#mlst-definitions-file-tab-delimited-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MLST definitions file, tab delimited format.</h3>

<p>--mlst_definitions</p>

<p>This is the file that tells you the ST number that is assigned to known combinations of alleles. Column 1 is the ST, and subsequent columns are the loci that make up the scheme. The names of these loci must match the allele names in the sequences database, e.g. adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, recA in the E. coli scheme. If you download data from pubmlst this should not be a problem. Sometimes there are additional columns in this file, e.g. a column assigning STs to clonal complexes. srst2 will ignore any columns that don't match gene names found in the allele sequences file.</p>

<h1>
<a name="gene-databases" class="anchor" href="#gene-databases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gene databases</h1>

<p>In addition to MLST, srst2 can do gene/allele detection. This works by mapping reads to each of the reference sequences in a fasta file(s) (provided through --gene_db) and reporting details of all genes that are covered above a certain level (--min_coverage, 90% by default). </p>

<p>If the input database contains different alelles of the same gene, srst2 can report just the best matching allele for that gene (much like with MLST we report the best matching allele for each locus in the scheme). This makes the output manageable, as you will get one column per gene/locus (e.g. blaCTX-M) which reports the specific allele that was called in each sample (e.g. blaCTX-M-15 in sample A, blaCTX-M-13 in sample B).</p>

<p>We have provided a preliminary set of resistance genes in the /data directory of srst2, this is based on the ResFinder database and CARD. The fasta file (data/resistance.fasta) is ready for use with srst2.</p>

<p>You can however format any sequence set for screening with srst2. See instructions at the bottom of this page.</p>

<a name="output-files" class="anchor" href="#output-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output files</h1>

<h3>
<a name="mlst-results" class="anchor" href="#mlst-results"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MLST results</h3>

<p>If MLST sequences and profiles were provided, STs will be printed in tab-delim format to a file called "[outputprefix]__mlst__[db]__results.txt", e.g.: "strainArun1__mlst__Escherichia_coli__results.txt".</p>

<p>The format looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Sample  ST      adk     fumC    gyrB    icd     mdh     purA    recA    mismatches      uncertainty     depth

</code></pre>

<p>Each locus has a column in which the best scoring allele number is printed. </p>

<p>* indicates the best scoring allele has &gt;=1 mismatch (SNP or indel, according to majority rules consensus of the aligned reads vs the allele sequence). Details of the mismatches are given in the mismatches column. This often means you have a novel allele. </p>

<p>? indicates uncertainty in the result because the best scoring allele has some low-depth bases; either the the first or last 2 bases of the allele had &lt;N reads mapped, or a truncation was called in which neigbhbouring bases were coverd with &lt;N reads, or the average depth across the whole allele was &lt;X. N is set by the parameter --min_edge_depth (default 2), X is set by --min_depth (default 5). The source of the uncertainty is printed to the uncertainty column. </p>

<p>- indicates that no allele could be assigned (generally means there were no alleles that were &gt;90% covered by reads) </p>

<p>If the combination of these alleles appears in the ST definitions file provided by --mlst_definitions, this ST will be printed in the ST column. "NF" indicates the allele combination was not found; "ND" indicates ST calculations were not done (because no ST definitions were provided). Here, * next to the ST indicates that there were mismatches against at least one of the alleles. This suggests that you have a novel variant of this ST rather than a precise match to this ST. ? indicates that there was uncertainty in at least one of the alleles. In all cases, the ST is calculated using the best scoring alleles, whether or not there are mismatches or uncertainty in those calls.</p>

<p>The <em>mismatches</em> column gives details of any mismatches (defined by majority rules consensus of the aligned reads vs the allele sequence) against the top scoring allele that is reported in the corresponding locus column. Possibilities are: (i) snps, adk-1/1snp indicates there was 1 SNP against the adk-1 allele; (ii) indels, adk-1/2indel indicates there were 1 indels (insertion or deletion calls in the alignment); (iii) holes, adk-1/5holes indicates there were 5 sections of the allele sequence that were not covered in the alignment and pileup (e.g. due to truncation at the start or end of the gene, or large deletions within the gene).</p>

<p>The <em>uncertainty</em> column gives details of parts of the top scoring alleles for which the depth of coverage was too low to give confidence in the result, this may be zero or any number up to the specified cutoff levels set via --min_edge_depth and --min_depth. Possibilities are considered in this order: (i) edge depth, adk-1/edge1.0 indicates that the mean read depth across either the first 2 or last 2 bases of the assigned allele was 1.0; this is monitored particularly because coverage at the ends of the allele sequences is dependent on bowtie2 to properly map reads that overhang the ends of the allele sequences, which is not as confident as when the whole length of a read maps within the gene (reported if this value is below the cutoff specified (default --min_edge_depth 2), low values can be interpreted as indicating uncertainty in the result as we can’t confidently distinguish alleles that differ at these low-covered bases); (ii) truncations, adk-1/del1.0 indicates that a truncation or large deletion was called for which the neighbouring 2 bases were covered to depth 1.0, this can be interpreted as indicating there is only very weak evidence for the deletion, as it is likely just due to random decline in coverage at this point (reported if this value is below the cutoff specified (default --min_edge_depth 2); (iii) average depth, adk-1/depth3.5 indicates that the mean read depth across the length of the assigned allele was 3.5 (reported if this value is below the cutoff specified, which by default is --min_depth 5)</p>

<p>The <em>depth</em> column indicates the mean read depth across the length of all alleles which were assigned a top scoring allele number (i.e. excluding any which are recorded as '-'). So if there are 7 loci with alleles called, this number represents the mean read depth across those 7 loci. If say, 2 of the 7 alleles were not called (recorded as ‘-’), the mean depth is that of the 5 loci that were called.</p>

<h1>
<a name="known-issues" class="anchor" href="#known-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known issues</h1>

<p>Reference indexing - srst2 uses bowtie2 for mapping reads to reference sequences. To do this, srst2 must first check the index exists, call bowtie2-build to generate the index if it doesn't already exist, and then call bowtie2 to map the reads to this indexed reference. Occasionallly bowtie2 will return an Error message saying that it doesn't like the index. This seems to be due to the fact that if you submit multiple srst2 jobs to a cluster at the same time, they will all test for the presence of the index and, if index files are present, will proceed with mapping... but this doesn't mean the indexing process is actually finished, and so errors will arise. The simple way out of this is, if you are running lots of srst2 jobs, FIRST index your reference(s) for bowtie2 and samtools (using 'bowtie2-build ref.fasta ref.fasta' and 'samtools faidx ref.fasta'), then submit your srst2 jobs. The slurm_srst2.py script takes care of this by formatting the databases before submitting any srst2 jobs.</p>

<p>Note that, as the databases have not been indexed for bowtie2 yet, that srst2 has to run bowtie2-build which spits out a lot of messages to stdout. This is not a problem!</p>

<p>Bowtie2 also reports its mapping stats, it should indicate that there were only 400,882 reads in this data set, of which 0.02% mapped to our MLST/resistance loci. This probably won't be enough to get good quality information.</p>

<p>Check the log file (shigella1.log) to see what happened.</p>

<p>Outputs are printed to: </p>

<p>shigella1__mlst__Escherichia_coli#1__results.txt - mlst results only </p>

<p>shigella1__fullgenes__resistance__results.txt - resistance results, one line per gene</p>

<p>shigella1__ERR024070.resistance.scores - full score &amp; alignment info for resistance genes with &gt;90% coverage</p>

<p>Because we ran with the --save_scores flag, we have also got a scores file for each database, which details the score and mapping information for every allele in that database.</p>

<p>The ST was not called correctly because depth was too low (average read depth 2.19; this is printed in the MLST result table):</p>

<pre><code>Sample  ST      adk     fumC    gyrB    icd     mdh     purA    recA    mismatches      uncertainty     depth

<p>Only 1 resistance gene was detected with &gt;90% coverage (the default threshold), which looks like a variant of strB (marked with * to indicate it was not a precise match, and ? to indicate uncertainty because some bases weren't covered):</p>

<p>If you look in the scores file (ERR024070.resistance.srst2.pileup.table.scores) you will see that two different alleles of strB were covered &gt;90% (both at 95%) and at low depth (~3.9x). </p>

<p>The Truncated_bases column shows 41, indicating there were 41 "holes" in the alignment of reads to these alleles. The next column, "DepthNeighbouringTruncation" contains 1, which tells us that the depth near these holes are 1x, indicating that they are likely to reflect random fluctuation in read depth rather than actual deletions.</p>

<p>This shows us that this level of data (which was considered a failed sequencing run) isn't enough to get good results. Luckily this genome was resequenced; let's see what happens when we analyse that data set.</p>

<a name="gene-database-format" class="anchor" href="#gene-database-format"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gene database format</h3>

<p>In addition to MLST, srst2 can do gene/allele detection. This works by mapping reads to each of the reference sequences in a fasta file(s) (provided through --gene_db) and reporting details of all genes that are covered above a certain level (--min_coverage, 90% by default). </p>

<p>If the input database contains different alelles of the same gene, srst2 can report just the best matching allele for that gene (much like with MLST we report the best matching allele for each locus in the scheme). This makes the output manageable, as you will get one column per gene/locus (e.g. blaCTX-M) which reports the specific allele that was called in each sample (e.g. blaCTX-M-15 in sample A, blaCTX-M-13 in sample B).</p>

<p>To do this properly, srst2 needs to know which of the reference sequences are alleles of the same gene. This is done by adhering to the following format in the naming of the sequences (i.e. the headers in the fasta sequence for the database):</p>

<p>&gt;[clusterUniqueIdentifier]__[clusterSymbol]__[alleleSymbol]__[alleleUniqueIdentifier]</p>

<p>e.g. in the resistance gene database provided, the first entry is:</p>

<p>&gt;344__blaOXA__blaOXA-181__1</p>

<p>Note these are separated by two underscores. The individual components are:</p>

<p>clusterUniqueIdentifier = 344;  unique identifier for this cluster (uniquely identifes the cluster)
clusterSymbol = blaOXA;  gene symbol for this cluster (may be shared by multiple clusters)
alleleSymbol = blaOXA-181;  full name of this allele
alleleUniqueIdentifier = 1;  uniquely identifies the sequence</p>

<p>Ideally the alleleSymbol would be unique (as it is in the reference.fasta file provided). However it doesn't have to be: if allele symbols are not unique, then srst2 will use the combination '[alleleSymbol]__[alleleUniqueIdentifier]' to  uniquely identify the sequence in the resulting reports, so that you can trace exactly which sequence was present in each sample.</p>

<p>Additional gene annotation can appear on the header line, after a space. This additional info will be printed in the full genes report, but not in the compiled results files.</p>

<p>e.g. for the blaOXA sequence above, the full header is actually:</p>

<p>&gt;344__blaOXA__blaOXA-181__1 blaOXA-181_1_HM992946; HM992946; betalactamase</p>

<a name="sourcing-suitable-gene-databases" class="anchor" href="#sourcing-suitable-gene-databases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sourcing suitable gene databases</h3>

<p>To get started, we have provided a resistance gene database (data/resistance.fasta) and code (database_clustering/) to extract virulence factors for a genus of interest from the Virulence Factor DB (detailed instructions below).</p>

<p>If you want to use your own database of allele sequences, with the reporting behaviour described, you will need to assign your sequences to clusters and use this header format. To facilitate this, use the scripts provided in the database_clustering directory provided with srst2, and follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>You can also use unclustered sequences. This is perfectly fine for gene detection applications, where you have one representative allele sequence for each gene, and you simply want to know which samples contain a sequence that is similar to this one (e.g. detecting plasmid replicons, where there is one target sequence per replicon). However, this won't work well for allele typing. If the sequence database contains multiple allele sequences for the same gene, then all of these that are covered above the length threshold (default 90%) will be reported in the output, which makes for messy reporting. If you do this, you would probably find it most useful to look at the full gene results table rather than looking at the compiled results output.</p>

<p>Use this info to generate the appropriate headers for srst2 to read. The provided script, csv_to_gene_db.py can help:</p>

<pre><code>csv_to_gene_db.py -h

Usage: csv_to_gene_db.py [options]

Options:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -t TABLE_FILE, --table=TABLE_FILE
                        table to read (csv)

  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --out=OUTPUT_FILE
                        output file (fasta)

  -s SEQ_COL, --seq_col=SEQ_COL
                        column number containing sequences

  -f FASTA_FILE, --fasta=FASTA_FILE
                        fasta file to read sequences from (must specify which
                        column in the table contains the sequence names that
                        match the fasta file headers)

  -c HEADERS_COL, --headers_col=HEADERS_COL
                        column number that contains the sequence names that
                        match the fasta file headers

</code></pre>

<p>The input table should be comma-separated (csv, unix newline characters) and have these columns:</p>

<p>seqID,clusterid,gene,allele,(DNAseq),other....</p>

<p>which will be used to make headers of the required form [clusterID]__[gene]__[allele]__[seqID] [other stuff]</p>

<p>If you have the sequences as a column in the table, specify which column they are in using -s:
csv_to_gene_db.py -t genes.csv -o genes.fasta -s 5</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have sequences in a separate fasta file, you can provide this file via -f. You will also need to have a column in the table that links the rows to unique sequences, specify which column this is using -c:
csv_to_gene_db.py -t genes.csv -o genes.fasta -f rawseqs.fasta -c 5</p>

<h3>
<a name="clustering-sequences" class="anchor" href="#clustering-sequences"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clustering sequences</h3>

<p>If your sequences are not already assigned to gene clusters, you can do this automatically using CD-HIT (<a href="http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/">http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/</a>).</p>

<p>1 - Run CD-HIT to cluster the sequences at 90% nucleotide identity:</p>

<pre><code>cdhit-est -i rawseqs.fasta -o rawseqs_cdhit90 -d 0 &gt; rawseqs_cdhit90.stdout
</code></pre>

<p>2 - Parse the cluster output and tabulate the results, check for inconsistencies between gene names and the sequence clusters, and generate individual fasta files for each cluster to facilitate further checking:</p>

<pre><code>python cdhit_to_csv.py --cluster_file rawseqs_cdhit90.clstr --infasta raw_sequences.fasta --outfile rawseqs_clustered.csv
</code></pre>

<p>For comparing gene names to cluster assignments, this script assumes very basic nomenclature of the form gene-allele, ie a gene symbol followed by '-' followed by some more specific allele designation. E.g. adk-1, blaCTX-M-15. The full name of the gene (adk-1, blaCTX-M-15) will be stored as the allele, and the bit before the '-' will be stored as the name of the gene cluster (adk, blaCTX). This won't always give you exactly what you want, because there really are no standards for gene nomenclature! But it will work for many cases, and you can always modify the script if you need to parse names in a different way. Note though that this only affects how sensible the gene cluster nomenclature is going to be in your srst2 results, and will not affect the behaviour of the clustering (which is purely sequence based using cdhit) or srst2 (which will assign a top scoring allele per cluster, the cluster name may not be perfect but the full allele name will always be reported anyway).</p>

<p>3 - Convert the resulting csv table to a sequence database using:</p>

<pre><code>csv_to_gene_db.py -t rawseqs_clustered.csv -o seqs_clustered.fasta -f rawseqs.fasta -c 4
</code></pre>

<p>The output file, seqs_clustered.fasta, should now be ready to use with srst2 (--gene_db seqs_clustered.fasta).</p>

<p>If there are potential inconsistencies detected at step 2 above (e.g. multiple clusters for the same gene, or different gene names within the same cluster), you may like to investigate further and change some of the cluster assignments or cluster names. You may find it useful to generate neighbour joining trees for each cluster that contains &gt;2 genes, using align_plot_tree_min3.py</p>

<a name="screening-for-resistance-genes-with-srst2" class="anchor" href="#screening-for-resistance-genes-with-srst2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Screening for resistance genes with SRST2</h3>

<p>A preliminary set of resistance genes is in the /data directory of srst2, this is based on the ResFinder database and CARD. The fasta file is ready for use with SRST2. The CSV table contains the same sequence information, but in tabular format for easier parsing/editing.</p>

<p>An easy way to add sequences to this database would be to add new rows to the table, and then generate an updated fasta file using:</p>

<pre><code>csv_to_gene_db.py -t rawseqs_clustered.csv -o seqs_clustered.fasta -s rawseqs.fasta -c 5

<p>The VFDB houses sets of virulence genes for a range of bacterial genera, see <a href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/">http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/</a>.</p>

<p>To type these virulence genes using SRST2, download the full set of sequences from the VFDB website (<a href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/Down/CP_VFs.ffn.gz">http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/Down/CP_VFs.ffn.gz</a>) and follow these steps to generate SRST2-compatible files for your genus of interest.</p>

<p>1 - Extract virulence genes by genus from the main VFDB file, CP_VFs.ffn:</p>

<pre><code>python VFDBgenus.py --infile CP_VFs.ffn --genus Clostridium
</code></pre>

<p>or, to get all availabel genera in separate files:</p>

<pre><code>python VFDBgenus.py --infile CP_VFs.ffn
</code></pre>

<p>2 - Run CD-HIT to cluster the sequences for this genus, at 90% nucleotide identity:</p>

<pre><code>cd-hit -i Clostridium.fsa -o Clostridium_cdhit90 -c 0.9 &gt; Clostridium_cdhit90.stdout
</code></pre>

<p>3 - Parse the cluster output and tabulate the results using the specific Virulence gene DB compatible script:</p>

<pre><code>python VFDB_cdhit_to_csv.py --cluster_file Clostridium_cdhit90.clstr --infile Clostridium.fsa --outfile Clostridium_cdhit90.csv
</code></pre>

<p>4 - Convert the resulting csv table to a SRST2-comptaible sequence database using:</p>

<pre><code>python csv_to_gene_db.py -t Clostridium_cdhit90.csv -o Clostridium_VF_clustered.fasta -s 5
</code></pre>

<p>The output file, Clostridium_VF_clustered.fasta, should now be ready to use with srst2 (--gene_db Clostridium_VF_clustered.fasta).</p>
